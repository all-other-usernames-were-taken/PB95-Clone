# pb95-clone
A ProgressBar95 clone written in QuickBasic!

## Compiling
As far as I know it only runs in VB4DOS, as that's what I use as my IDE. But, it likely would work with QB64 and possibly QB45 with enough effort.

Anyway, you may need to change the line in PB-CLONE.MAK that says `C:\VB\INC\MOUSE.BAS` to wherever your MOUSE.BAS is on your QB installation.

That's it, really.
